                “Sorry, Ade. Thank you for letting me know… but I don’t want to leave. I don’t want to return to my previous life. I know I’m sacrificing a lot to live in this world. I’m sure it’ll take time for me to adjust to this world knowing what I know, but I feel more comfortable having secured happiness here than the variance of the real world.”
                <br><br>
                Ade hugs you. “If that’s your choice then so be it. I want to stay with you. I may not agree with the foundation that this world was built on, but if I can be with you then I’ll tolerate it.”
                <br><br>
                You and Ade decide to stay in the world. Within a matter of days the glitch is quickly discovered and patched. You decide to move in with Ade in another part of the city. For the most part, your new life is fulfilling and gratifying. You have trouble adjusting to the reality that the world you live in is simulated, but over time you and Ade learn to accept it and appreciate what PETAR is providing: a life without hardships. From time to time, you have thoughts of regret, but overall you live the rest of your life peacefully.
