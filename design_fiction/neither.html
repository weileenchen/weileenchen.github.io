                You decide that accepting the money from the NDA would be unacceptable, but you also decide against reporting PETAR. The people at PETAR did not intentionally cause you any stress or harm, and it does seem that some people are happy with it. You start looking back at the days you spent in Shoudale, the days you spent in the simulation, where nothing mattered and you didn’t have to think about any of this. “Would it be so wrong for people to be able to escape a life they’re not happy with?” you ask yourself. “Is it really up to me to decide on everyone’s behalf the validity of this technology?”

                You decide to return to your old life. With a little bit of physical therapy, time and new furniture, you start to assimilate back into normal society. Perhaps it’s best to just live on and see what the future holds. Sometimes, when you question whether you made the right decision, With this in mind, you slowly forget all about PETAR and move on.
