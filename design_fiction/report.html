                You start to think about the scene you saw at the hospital. The seemingly lifeless bodies piled up in barren rooms. Is this something you were really fine with? Even if this technology were to benefit people in the future, is it worth the collateral damage that’s already been done? You recall your conversation with Layla and her experiences with PETAR. As you sit in silence for what seems like twenty minutes, you make up your mind. No, it isn't right. You decide that you are going to take PETAR down. 
                <br><br>
                You decide to ask Layla for her help, and she agrees to testify along with you. You explain to her your plan to plant an anonymous tip to law enforcement about the activities of PETAR while simultaneously exposing details to the public. You work with Layla tirelessly to compile all the details of the PETAR experiment including what you saw at the hospital, the violations of privacy, and treatment of subjects post-experiment. As you finish writing, you feel a great sense of relief come over you. 
                <br><br>
                The next week, the news broke. The SWAT team had raided the PInedale General Hospital where the PETAR experiments had been taking place. They had forcibly taken everyone off of VR support and videos of them wheeling distraught patients out of the hospital began circulating the web. The incident made national news, and received very mixed responses among the populace. Some people were shocked that such experiments were being conducted and praised the police for their work in busting it. On the other hand, some people questioned law enforcement’s involvement in riding the facility. They called the move “authoritarian” and criticized the government for halting technology advances. The incident sparked a large scale discussion on the morality of such technologies moving forward. 
                <br><br>
                After a few weeks pass, you decide to meet up with Layla to talk. You sit down at the table across from her and turn on the television. The first thing that pops up is the news channel, which is still talking about PETAR. 
                <br><br>
                “They’re really making a ruckus out of this situation, aren’t they.” Layla says while looking out the window. 
                <br><br>
                “Yeah…” 
                <br><br>
                “Hey... do you think we did the right thing?” Layla asks you. 
                <br><br>
                “What do you mean?”
                <br><br>
                “I mean like, should we have really done this? So many people seem upset at us for making the choice to shut down PETAR. They said it wasn’t our responsibility to do so. Were we really in a position to decide for others?” 
                <br><br>
                “I don’t know...”
                <br><br>
                Layla shakes her head, as if trying to shake the thought from her head. “Ugh, whatever. I’m over it. At least we won’t have to continue living in this nightmare anymore.”
                <br><br>
                You shake your head in agreement. What’s done is done. PETAR is officially over, and that’s that. Perhaps, in the future, an entity similar to them will arise, in a time more suited to handle all its ethical challenges and responsibilities. You roll yourself over to the television and turn it off. Silence fills the room.
