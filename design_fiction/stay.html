                “I.. I wish to stay in this world” you respond hesitantly. The moment you speak those words, you wonder what the strange lady will say in response. Does she want me to say no? What will even happen to me now that I’ve said yes? Will you still be the same person after learning the truth? You look at Lila, who’s still busy taking notes on the clipboard. You sit there awkwardly as she continues to scribble, and after a few minutes of silence, she looks up and smiles.
                <br><br>
                “Alright, Miss Hayes, I’ve recorded your decision. Now, if I can just have your signature here, we’ll be on our merry way”
                <br><br>
                Lila hands you the clipboard she had been writing on. On the bottom, highlighted with red ink, were the words: “I, _________ , hereby forfeit my right to terminate my trial in the Pinedale Extrinsic Therapeutic Alternate Reality program and wish to maintain consciousness in the virtual world.” There seems to be over a dozen extra pages of random clauses and paragraphs that you don’t bother understanding. You look over the front page, and hastily write your name.
                <br><br>
                “Thank you for your cooperation, Miss Hayes. Your patronage is greatly appreciated for the success of the PETAR experiment. Oh, and one last thing. Would you like to retain your memories of this conversation?” 
                <br><br>
                You weren’t expecting this question. Is it best to live on knowing the truth, or is it best to live in oblivion, with life as you knew it before?
