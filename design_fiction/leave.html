                “I... I don’t want to stay. There’s no point living in this world when there's no meaning for anything I do. I don’t even know who I am anymore.” 
                <br><br>
                “Well then, Ms. Braye, I’ll organize the documents for your termination from the experiment. You’ll awake soon in your assigned room. Thank you for participating in the PETAR project, I wish you well.”
                <br><br>
                Lila reaches her hand out, and you promptly shake it. Her hand feels cold to the touch. She turns towards the door and you watch as she exits the room. As the door shuts with a loud thud, the sound of her footsteps also stop. You head to the door and peer into the hallway, but there is no one to be seen.
                <br><br>
                “Makes sense huh, I guess this is a virtual world after all.” You mumble to yourself.
                <br><br>
                You turn around to finish your breakfast, but as you slowly tread closer towards the table, the farther away it seems to be. You try to drag your feet, but they feel heavier with every step you take. Your consciousness starts to waver as you lose all motor control. Just as quickly as Lila had seemingly disappeared, you black out.
                <br><br>
                As you regain consciousness, the first thing you hear is a loud buzzing sound nearby surrounded by the loud chattering of people around you. Your head feels heavy, and your vision still appears to be impaired for unknown reasons. 
                <br><br>
                “Oh doctor! She’s awake.”
                <br><br>
                “Is she now? Took long enough for her to come by. Prepare her for the diagnostic.”
                <br><br>
                “Yes, doctor.”
                <br><br>
                You hear people scurry around the room and the noise of what seems to be large machinery being moved around. There’s a faint smell of alcohol that permeates the air contrasted by a wandering metallic scent. 
                <br><br>
                “Alright, let’s get this thing off you”
                <br><br>
                You feel a tug around your head, as if something strapped on was being removed. 
                <br><br>
                “Annnndddd, we’re clear. Your vision should return in a few moments, Ms. Braye.”
                <br><br>
                Your vision starts to clear and you start to survey your surroundings. The room is dimly lit and crowded with people in large lab coats. The ceiling is lined with what appeared to be tiny sprinklers connected by wires. You slowly bring yourself up.
                <br><br>
                “Where am I?” you exclaim. A nurse shuffles closer to you and smiles a great big smile as she continues removing wires off of your arms.
                <br><br>
                “Oh, sorry, you must still be in shock from awaking after being in slumber for so long. Let me catch you up. You’ve been in the virtual world of Shoudale for the last month, so your mind might still be hazy. Other motor functions might also be inhibited so please exercise caution. That should be it for the precautions. My name is Vivian, by the way. I’ll be your personal nurse while you recover.”
                <br><br>
                You feel a slight migraine coming on and try to rub your temples with your right hand, which is for some reason incredibly hard to lift. You observe quietly as Vivian scampers around, taking medicine bottles out from a drawer. She’s humming as she rummages through the cabinet and takes out a needle and a first aid kit. 
                <br><br>
                Vivian notices you staring at that needle and says, “Oh don’t worry sweetheart! It’ll be over in a pinch. Hehe, get it? A pinch.” How corny, you can’t help but think. Her perfect golden curls bounce with every step as she sets up next to you. 
                <br><br>
                “Here are some pills to help with any nausea or migraines you may be experiencing. I’m just going to do a standard blood test and you’ll be set.” She gives you an intense look, making you shift uncomfortably in the hospital bed. “Oh you poor thing! Re-adjusting to your life here can’t be easy. I know some people who have gone through this exact situation. Maybe talking to them will help alleviate some stress.”
                <br><br>
                She looks at you, as if waiting for a response. You stay silent. 
                <br><br>
                “Not much of a talker, huh?” Vivian rubs an alcohol pad on your inner elbow. You feel a slight pinch as she slowly injects the needle into your vein. With a sigh, she says, “Look, I’m only asking you to consider it. You could talk to my friend Layla. She had a hard time coming to terms with all of this. Just let me know if you want to talk to her.” 
                You have to admit that you are curious about this Layla person. “Ok, I would like to talk to Layla.” You respond. Vivian nods. 
                <br><br>
                The next few days seem to be a blur. You spend a few hours every day doing physical therapy. Your mother, upon hearing that you’ve woken up, immediately rushes over to the hospital room within an hour, tears in her eyes.
                <br><br>
                “I’m so glad you decided to stay, honey,” She says, eyes still glistening. She kisses you on the forehead. “I think you made the right choice.”
                <br><br>
                When you get discharged, you are handed a small bag full of what seems to be your clothes and other necessities. Vivian helps you into your automated wheelchair. Before you are discharged, she scribbles something on a small piece of paper and hands it to you. “That’s Layla’s address. She spends most of her time inside that tiny house of hers, so you can pop by and visit any time you like.” 
                <br><br>
                You thank the nurse, grab your belongings, and exit your room with your mother. On the way there, you pass rooms that are occupied with other PETAR patients. You see nurses walking inside to occasionally check on them. The patients who are in a comatose state look so dull and lifeless, wires and plugs all over their bodies, not moving at all. It’s creepy. It’s not humane. You force yourself to look away.  
                <br><br>
                You reach into the side pocket of your bag, pulling out a black smart-phone. It is fully charged. You are startled that you still remember the password. Looking at the little slip of paper in your hand, you furiously type the address into the maps app. 
                <div class="ellipses">*       *       *</div>
                Your mother drops you off at a quaint house off the road. There is nothing remarkable about the house other than the fact that there was a wheelchair ramp built right next to the front steps. You ring the doorbell and wait. 
                <br><br>
                “Who is it?” A gruff voice answers from inside the house. 
                <br><br>
                “Hi Layla, my name is Lubna. Nurse Vivian told me about you and I just wanted to speak with you a little bit, if that’s alright.” You respond. 
                <br><br>
                Silence. Then you hear some shuffling and the front door opens slowly. A middle aged woman is standing on the other side, with one hand on her hip. The woman’s hair is short and graying. You can see her prosthetic leg peeking out from under her shorts. 
                <br><br>
                Layla gives you a once-over and opens the door wider. “Come on in.” Layla closes the door behind you and takes a seat on the couch. 
                <br><br>
                “Who are you and what do you want?” She asks bluntly. 
                <br><br>
                “Nurse Vivian referred me to you. I just got out of PETAR. I suppose I’m still in shock and thought I should talk to someone who has had a similar experience.”
                <br><br>
                Layla flinches visibly when you mention PETAR. She takes a deep breath. “There’s not much to say. PETAR messed up my life. I suppose I should start from the beginning. I had had a prosthetic leg for years. Never once did I feel like my life was shitty due to my leg until I met a PETAR representative. They found my information somehow and a representative just showed up at my door one day. That woman showed up every single day and I actually started to become friends with her.  I didn’t realize it then, but as time went on she would start saying little things to make me unhappy about my life. ‘It really sucks that you can’t play soccer like you used to,’ she said. I didn’t really think much of it at first.”
                <br><br>
                “That’s so messed up.” You respond. “She made you feel bad about your leg? Just because you’re disabled doesn’t mean you’re any less of a person!”
                <br><br>
                Layla nods sadly. “I didn’t realize it back then, but she was so manipulative. She was always saying to me, ‘Do you ever wonder if your boyfriend would love you more if you didn’t have a prosthetic leg?’ I started getting more paranoid and began pushing him away. When my boyfriend finally broke up with me, I really did think that it was because of my leg. I called up the representative that very day and decided that I wanted to go through with the VR. Just up and left everything behind.”
                <br><br>
                “They made you feel like technology was the answer to all of your problems. Just like they did with me.” You say. “The only thing PETAR helped us do was run away from our problems. I just needed some therapy and healthy ways to cope with my problems and PETAR couldn’t provide either.” 
                <br><br>
                “I’m so sorry you had to go through that,” you say.
                <br><br>
                “Me too. I’m glad I left. After a while in VR I realized life was meaningless. I wasn’t content in there knowing everything was fake. Felt wrong. Everyday was just perfect. And perfect became bland. Plus I never felt completely alone. It always felt like I was being watched and that made me so uncomfortable. 
                <br><br>
                “Pretending like I was ‘normal’ in VR didn’t make my life better. They made me feel like my leg was the problem with my life. All I needed was some therapy and a way to deal with my issues, but they convinced me that running away to some pretend land would solve everything. And it didn’t. 
                <br><br>
                “When the free trial was over, I decided to return back to my normal life.” Her voice wavered. She took a deep breath and continued. “So I packed up my things and came back home only to find out that my mother had died two weeks after I left. They didn’t tell me nothing about it either! They kept claiming they had to say nothing because they wanted to make the trial as accurate as possible, but how could you keep information like that from somebody? I missed my own mother’s funeral!” Tears start streaming down Layla’s cheeks and she stops talking.
                <br><br>
                You sit there in shock as Layla dabs her eyes with tissues. How could PETAR do all of this?
                After a few deep breaths, Layla continues. “Maybe if I hadn’t met that PETAR lady, I could’ve actually worked through my problems instead of trying to run away from them. I would’ve been able to see my mum in her final moments. Of course they wouldn’t tell me about my mom or I would’ve left earlier, and they wouldn’t get any money now would they?”
                <br><br>
                You continue chatting with Layla for 30 more minutes. Afterwards you call your mom to drive you back and thank Layla for her time.
                <div class="ellipses">*       *       *</div>
                You are unsure of how many days go by, but you just can’t bring yourself to do anything. You are unsure of your decisions and things just don’t sit right with you. Ding dong. You hear your mom walk to the door and greet the unexpected visitor. 
                <br><br>
                “Honey!” She calls out to you. “Come down. Arjun is here!”
                <br><br>
                Arjun Willi. You remember him. He was a friend of yours who worked at the hospital. After your accident, he suggested that you speak with a PETAR representative. 
                <br><br>
                You push the blanket off of you and, using a dangly bar hanging over your bed, pull yourself off of the bed and into your wheelchair. You go downstairs and see Arjun sitting on the couch, waiting for you. Your mom has already gotten some snacks and set it out for the both of you. 
                <br><br>
                “Let me get you some tea. I’ll just let you guys talk,” she says and rushes into the kitchen. 
                <br><br>
                “Lubna, how are --” 
                <br><br>
                “What are you doing here Arjun?” You cut him short.
                <br><br>
                “What’s with the hostility?” He asks, surprised. 
                <br><br>
                “How can you support PETAR?” You ask, getting straight to the point. “How can you support pushing people to run away from their problems and causing so much more trauma for them? PETAR has stolen loved ones away. I can barely function days after I found out that I have this other life! This whole situation has left my mother in shambles, even though she’s trying her best to stay happy.” 
                <br><br>
                “Lubna, I’m honestly shocked that you would react like this.” Arjun said. “I didn’t force you to make this decision. PETAR has helped many people live a healthy and happy life. Sure, it’s a little shocking after the one month trial, but I can assure you that people do choose to live a VR life and live in peace. There’s even the option of erasing their old memories so they can live out their VR days blissfully.” 
                <br><br>
                You shake your head furiously. “What’s shocking is that you don’t understand how wrong it is to make people with disabilities feel like they need to be ‘normal’ to live a happy life! Everything in that VR is fake! All PETAR has done is made me run away from all of my problems. And wiping memories?? You have the ability to access memories?? That’s a disgusting breach of privacy. Living your life in VR should not be allowed. It should be banned forever.” You can’t help but get emotional. You think about how Layla has lost her mother. “Can you truly say that everyone joined PETAR by their own free will? Can you truly say that you haven’t made us feel like freaks who have no place in society, so we were forced to live in a made-up world?”
                <br><br>
                Arjun pauses for a few seconds before responding. “But you were happy in VR. The majority are. I support PETAR because it’s for the greater good. The patients are happy and they have the chance to live without being disabled. I’d say that’s a win for everyone.” 
                <br><br>
                “Do you honestly believe, with 100% certainty, that this technology is helping people?” you ask Arjun.
                <br><br>
                “Absolutely. Listen Lubna, I admit that it has a few issues right now, but even if it’s not quote-unquote ‘perfect’ yet, this technology could help save MILLIONS. It would be a complete waste for it to die now. We could have the power to change people’s lives for the better. You’ve experienced living in Shoudale yourself, would you consider your experiences in the virtual world meaningless?”
                <br><br>
                You ponder the thought. Is Arjun right? Those days that you spent in the virtual world, regardless of if they were “fake” or not, were happy days. If this technology was to succeed in the future, it COULD help a lot of people. Is it really your call to potentially ruin the lives of others dependent on the PETAR project? Could you shoulder the burden of thousands? 
                <br><br>
                Arjun interrupts your thoughts. “Listen, I’m really sorry that you didn’t enjoy your experience, but I stand firm on the belief that PETAR is for the greater good. Do you understand where I’m coming from? Do you think you could forgive PETAR?” 
                <br><br>
                You think about it for a bit more before you shake your head in confusion. “I.. I don’t know. I think I need some time to think about it.” 
                <br><br>
                Arjun shrugs. “Okay, I get it. We were anticipating this response from you after we found out that you had spoken with Layla.”
                <br><br>
                Found out? How did they find out? 
                <br><br>
                “The company is giving you an offer to sign this non-disclosure agreement,” Arjun says as he pulls out a paper from his briefcase. “You get a hefty sum of money just to ensure that you don’t try to sue us or do anything reckless. I’ll leave the form here for now. Come by when you have made a decision.”
                <div class="ellipses">*       *       *</div>
                It’s been a few hours since Arjun has left and you’re still struggling to process everything. You hate PETAR and what it’s doing to other people. You could go to the authorities and report them for selling your data without consent or for causing emotional distress. You could just expose them and get them shut down. You could team up with Layla and put an end to this for good. 
                <br><br>
                Then again... PETAR’s intentions are not bad. PETAR is meant to help people, even if it does unintentionally cause harm along the way. What is the right decision here? Should you just sign the NDA, take the money and forget about everything that happened? All of this starts to give you a major headache. 
                <br><br>
                Or should you just do nothing? Is it your duty to tell people what you know, or is this not up for you to decide? Maybe you should just forget all this drama and continue living your life before you ever learned about PETAR. That would definitely save you from any more stress and drama. Maybe you could just sign the NDA. It looked like a lot of money and would pay off any debts you’ve accumulated in the past. Would taking the money be wrong?
            </div>
            <div class="choice">
                <div class="choice-header">Do you wish to report the PETAR Project to the authorities and potentially shut down the technology that could be benefitting thousands? <br><br> Or do you wish to sign the NDA, remain silent on the wrongs of PETAR and live on knowing what PETAR is doing? <br><br>Or should you just do nothing? Don’t sign the NDA, and don’t report them to the authorities. Should you just live your life and try to move away from PETAR?
