                “I don’t want to remember any of this. I’m happy the way I’m living right now. I don’t care if it’s not ‘real’, going back to the real world would ruin what I have built up in this world.” 
                <br><br>
                “Wise choice, Ms. Braye. Thank you for your service to the PETAR experiment. I shall arrange your memory erasure right this instance.”
                <br><br>
                Lila pulls up the digital screen again, and proceeds to punch in a sequence of buttons into the system. “Everything appears to be in order, Ms. Braye. You’ll be back to your normal life soon!” she says. In the span of a few seconds, your mind suddenly blanks, and you drift into deep sleep.

                It’s a typical rainy day in Shoudale. The rain clouds fill the sky outside your apartment as you hear the sound of raindrops strike against the window. You wake up a little earlier than usual due to having a nightmare you can’t seem to remember. What did you dream about? You try to think back, but all your recent memories just leave you feeling happy… so instead you decide to take the extra time to make some breakfast––scrambled eggs and toast. As you finish up your last few bites, you get dressed and start to head out for work. As you approach the door you feel a faint feeling of dejavu, but you shake it off. You try to figure out why you woke up feeling so unpleasant, but the nightmare seems so long ago. It must be due to the cold weather. 
                <br><br>
                You decide to walk to your workplace. As you step outdoors, you realize that you forgot to carry an umbrella. It’s only a twenty-minute walk, so decide to run to your workplace, but the rain quickly becomes heavier. As you pass a crossroad, a car speeds by with a splash. You close your eyes, anticipating the spray of water, but all you feel are tiny little pokes on your body. You open your eyes to see that your clothes are all wet, but they don’t feel damp at all. 
                <br><br>
                As you observe your clothes, confused, the car reverses back to you and the driver bustles out of the car towards you. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t see you there! Is there anything I can do?”
                <br><br>
                Wow, everyone is being so kind. You feel the water drops fall onto your body as it continues to rain, but your clothes aren’t uncomfortably sticking to your body. 
                <br><br>
                “Miss?” The driver interrupts your thoughts. “Are you okay?” You decide to accept the kindness.
                <br><br>
                “Would you be willing to drive me to my office? It’s about four blocks away on Dalton Street.” 
                <br><br>
                “No problem at all! You can call me Ade.” The driver smiles at you, but in his eyes you see a mixture of emotions—is that somberness?
                <br><br>
                “I’m Lubna. Nice to meet you.” You get into the car. 
                <br><br>
                In the car, both of you are silent for a while, until Ade breaks the ice. “Shoudale is a great city, isn’t it? I came here over a week ago and feel nothing but happy vibes here.”
                <br><br>
                “I can’t really remember when I came here, but so far I think Shoudale is nice. Everyone seems kind.” You notice a trace of disappointment in Ade’s eyes as he hears your response.
                <br><br>
                “Are you happy in Shoudale?” Ade asked.
                <br><br>
                “Yeah… Things don’t annoy me as often as they used to,” you respond. “I used to get super annoyed at small things like getting wet, but now I feel fine. I guess Shoudale has helped me calm down.”
                <br><br>
                “Do you ever feel weird about being happy so easily?” Ade asks.
                <br><br>
                Ade’s question shocks you and makes you slightly uncomfortable. “Are you implying that I should?”
                <br><br>
                Ade responds calmly, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you at all. I just feel like having a world be so happy is a bit odd. You know, when happiness becomes so easy to reach, will people become better people, or worse? In my opinion, happiness is something that should come from personal effort, but it feels like in Shoudale happiness is so easily given and taken.” 
                <br><br>
                You start to panic. Why is he saying all of this? Was accepting a ride from this stranger the wrong choice? What if he’s dangerous? Ade smiles slightly as he sees your concerned face and explains, “I studied Philosophy in college. Sorry if I’m ranting too much.” Ade’s laid-back smile calms you down a bit. 
                <br><br>
                Now that you think about it, you can’t recall ever being upset or angry while you’ve been here. “I mean, I guess what you’re saying does make sense. I do admit Shoudale can seem a bit too happy sometimes. But is that really a bad thing? What can be so wrong about always having happiness?”
                <br><br>
                Ade responds. “There’s this famous philosophical belief that people must devote their life to achieving the best possible balance of happiness over misery. But what happens when there’s no misery? Doesn’t the scale become unbalanced? The great Aristotle even believed that too much of a good thing can lead to negative results. What if people become lazier because they no longer have to work for their happiness? What if they start doing immoral things, like stealing or cheating, to achieve happiness?”
                <br><br>
                “Hmm… Maybe you’re right, but I guess I still prefer being happy. I remember being really frustrated and upset before I moved here, and I’m glad I’m not like that anymore. But I’ll try my best to stay grateful and hardworking to avoid all of that imbalance.” You respond. Ade nods in acknowledgement as he pulls up next to your workplace.
                <br><br>
                “Well, here you are. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, and I’m sorry again for splashing you earlier,” Ade says.
                <br><br>
                “No problem at all! Thanks for the ride, and I hope you have a good day!” You smile at him as you get out of the car.
                <br><br>
                “You too.” Ade smiles back but does not drive away until you enter the building.
                <br><br>
                You get to your seat and start to work. You take out the documents from your tote bag, and a piece of paper slips from it. You pick it up. It’s a photo of you and Ade taken in a car. You go pale. Why don’t you remember Ade? You try to rack your brain for any memory of him, but nothing is found and you start to feel a headache. Your colleague notices that you look pale and suggests you go home and take a sick day, but you assure them that you’re fine and turn back to your work. Maybe that wasn’t Ade. Maybe it’s just someone who looks like him. You force yourself to stop thinking about the photo and begin focusing on the stack of work piling on your desk. After an hour or so, you feel at ease again, and you barely remember the interaction you had with Ade. After all, there is no need to feel uneasy in Shoudale!
