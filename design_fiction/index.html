                It’s a typical morning in Shoudale. The sun is shining bright like always, with its yellow rays shining into your apartment. You woke up a little earlier than usual and decided to take the extra time to make some breakfast––scrambled eggs and toast. As you finish up your last few bites, you receive a knock on the door. You open the door to reveal a woman you don’t recognize. She is smiling at you.
            <br> <br>
                “Hello! Is this Lubna Braye?” She asks. Warily, you nod in response. “Great! My name is Lila. I need to discuss a few matters with you today. Are you free to talk right now?”
            <br> <br>
                “Well, actually I was about to head to work––” but Lila cuts you off. “Don’t worry don’t worry, I called them already and they are giving you the day off. So where would be best to chat?” You are thrown off guard. You have no idea who this Lila is and how she knows so much about you. “Um, I guess my office?”
            <br> <br>
                Lila smiles and steps into the apartment. “Please, lead the way!”
            <br> <br>
                Lila and you make your way into the office. You head to your desk and sit down in your office chair while Lila takes the seat facing the desk. For a few seconds there is silence. She’s still smiling and you start to get uncomfortable.
