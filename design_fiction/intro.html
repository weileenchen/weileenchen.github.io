                It’s a typical morning in Shoudale. The sun is bright like always, with its yellow rays shining into your apartment. You woke up a little earlier than usual and decided to take the extra time to make some breakfast––scrambled eggs and toast. As you finish up your last few bites, you receive a knock on the door. You open the door to reveal a woman you don’t recognize. She is smiling at you.
                <br><br>
                “Hello! Is this Lubna Braye?” She asks. Warily, you nod in response. “Great! My name is Lila. I need to discuss a few matters with you today. Are you free to talk right now?”
                <br><br>
                “Well, actually I was about to head to work––” but Lila cuts you off. “Don’t worry don’t worry, I called them already and they are giving you the day off. So where would be best to chat?” You are thrown off guard. You have no idea who this Lila is and how she knows so much about you. “Um, I guess my office?”
                <br><br>
                Lila smiles and steps into the apartment. “Please, lead the way!”
                <br><br>
                Lila and you make your way into the office. You head to your desk and sit down in your office chair while Lila takes the seat facing the desk. For a few seconds there is silence. She’s still smiling and you start to get uncomfortable.
                <br><br>
                “So,” you clear your throat. “What can I help you with?”
                <br><br>
                “I am with the managerial department from the Pinedale Center for Independent Living. I am here to let you know that this world is a simulation.” 
                <br><br>
                A small laugh accidentally escapes your mouth. She’s joking, right? Lila stares at you calmly, observing your every move. You’re confused. Why does she seem so serious?
                <br><br>
                “You’re joking…” you respond slowly. Lila smiles slightly before answering. “No, I’m not. You see, Shoudale itself is not a real city. It was built using the newest technology, the Pinedale Extrinsic Therapeutic Alternate Reality, or PETAR. In real life you are currently at Pinedale General hospital. You checked in over two months ago after you gained paralysis in both your legs. Are you starting to recall this?” 
                <br><br>
                At those words memories start flashing in and out of your mind. The car crash… the failed surgery… your mom hovering over your hospital bed, reassuring you everything will be okay while tears stream down her cheeks. Your heart drops down to your stomach. So those nightmares you had been having were real.
                <br><br>
                “Why am I here? Where is my real body?” You ask.
                <br><br>
                Lila assures you, “You are very much safe, don’t worry! In real life you are here.” Lila starts swatting at the air in front of her face and suddenly a holographic screen appears out of thin air. She taps onto the screen a few times and suddenly your vision goes completely black. You blink, and your vision returns, except you’re no longer in your office. The tall glass walls have been replaced by creamy white wallpaper, and you’re no longer sitting on your swivel chair, but lying in a twin bed with puffy white sheets. You try to turn your head to look to your right but you can’t.
                <br><br>
                “Where is this?” You ask. Lila responds, her voice almost as if she’s right behind you but her body is nowhere to be seen.
                <br><br>
                Lila continues: “You chose to test out our virtual reality program which was designed to give disabled people a better life, without their… disabilities. Everyone you have met in Shoudale are also currently residing in Pinedale. Like you, they also have some sort of disability in real life.” 
                <br><br>
                “So you’re saying that… everything here... everything I’ve done up until now is fake?” you reply.
                <br><br>
                “I don’t think ‘fake’ is the right word to describe it,” Lila says as she takes out a clipboard to write notes, “Think of it more as a simulated reality that you’ve conveniently been placed into.”
                <br><br>
                You struggle to breathe for a moment. Perhaps it’s the shock from the whole experience, or a direct result of the “reality” you’ve been living in collapsing right before your eyes. “Was there really a point in any of this?” you question yourself.  Your mind goes blank. This is so much to process. 
                <br><br>
                Finally another question pops into your head. You ask it. “You’re telling me all of this right now. Why?” You blink again and you are back in your office––well, virtual office. Lila is in front of you again, smiling.
                <br><br>
                “Well, when you first agreed to testing the virtual reality program you requested a trial run of one month. It has been a month since you joined, so now you have a choice to make.” Lila reaches into her purse and pulls out a piece of paper and a black pen. She slides them across the desk towards you, and as you look more closely at the paper you see that it appears to be a contract. “If you would like to stay, simply sign this paper and your body will be transported from Pinedale General Hospital to Pinedale Center for Independent Living. There, you can live in Shoudale for the rest of your life! Otherwise, you will have to leave Shoudale by the end of the day. However, please note that you must decide now, and you cannot change your decision. If you leave Shoudale, you cannot return, and if you stay, you cannot leave.”
                <br><br>
                You take a minute to ponder the choice given to you by Lila.
