                “I’ll leave this world with you.” you say without hesitation.
                <br><br>
                Ade seems happy with the decision you made. “I can take you to the garage today. I’ll show you the way there.”
                <br><br>
                You and Ade arrive at the garage. Ade tells you to get into an old wardrobe and to connect a cable to it. All of a sudden, your vision goes white and finally black. You feel something over your head and you take it off. You gently open your eyes and see the ceiling -- you realize that you escaped successfully. You maneuver yourself off your bed and crawl slowly to the hallway and call out to catch the attention of a nurse passing by. 
                <br><br>
                The nurse notices you and rushes to your room. A few minutes later, a doctor comes to you and explains that since you voided the agreements of PETAR, you cannot travel back to the virtual world. After filing some paperwork, you are moved to the general hospital for therapy. You meet up with Ade, and you start to attend physical therapy together while adapting to life outside. With a little bit of physical therapy, time and new furniture, you start to assimilate back into normal society. You think about your life back in VR from time to time, but over time you try to forget about your virtual life. You’re glad that this technology is being worked on and respect the intentions of PETAR, but you’re also glad that you decided to leave. You’re in the real world now and you are grateful you get to experience true emotions, struggles and joys.
