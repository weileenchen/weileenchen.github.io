                “Yes, I would like to retain my memories.” you reply.  You don’t know why, but you feel a compulsion to remember your encounter with the stranger. You feel uncomfortable at the thought of living out the rest of your life oblivious to the truth about the reality you are really living in. You notice that Lila frowns slightly, but quickly recovers.
                <br><br>
                “Are you sure about your choice Ms. Braye?” Lila replies. You ponder it for a second, and reply, “Yes, I’m sure.”
                <br><br>
                “Very well. Quite unfortunate events we have here Ms. Braye, but according to company guidelines I can’t deny your request. I shall put in the request for you to retain your memories then. Just know that you’re still unable to leave the city of Shoudale even with this knowledge. Many like you have also chosen to retain their memories, perhaps you can seek them out. In any case, I believe our time is up here. On behalf of Pinedale Technologies, we thank you for your continued patronage, Ms. Braye.”
                <br><br>
                After Lila leaves your place, you decide to walk around the neighborhood. As you’re waiting to cross the street, you feel a tap on your shoulder and look to your right. You immediately recognize the man tapping you. It’s your boyfriend. “Ade?” Ade immediately hugs you, but it doesn’t feel like a real hug. You feel weight being pushed around your arms and back, but you can’t feel the warmth of his hug or the texture of his clothes. It appears the VR isn’t able to replicate everything just like the real world. 
                <br><br>
                “Yes, Lubna, it’s me.”
                <br><br>
                Memories start to flood in your head as you start to remember the incident. You and Ade had been on a road trip when the brakes of the car suddenly failed and the car was driven down off the road.  Ade had been the driver and he had been thrown out of the car when it went off road. You hadn’t seen him since being put in Shoudale. 
                <br><br>
                You see tears in Ade’s eyes as he pulls away from you. “You remember everything, right?” Ade aks.
                <br><br>
                “Yeah, I remember everything. I asked to keep my memories.“ you can’t help but start tearing up as well. Ade strokes your hair as comfort.
                <br><br>
                “Calm down. As happy as I am to see you, we need to assess our situation. There’s not a lot of time. Listen, I met a guy who knows the truth about Shoudale and he told me everything. We need to leave this fake world immediately.” Ade is whispering, pulling you towards a more secluded area.
                <br><br>
                “What are you talking about?” You’re puzzled by what he says.
                <br><br>
                “So this city is designed for the less fortunate to live a normal life, but I think the developers messed up. The intention of PETAR and Shoudale is to build a utopia of happiness,” Ade explains.
                <br><br>
                “Utopia of happiness?”
                <br><br>
                “The universal law of this world is to keep everyone happy, or more precisely, to create a world of artificial happiness. I noticed it just last week. I witnessed a salesman arguing with a couple. It seemed that they disagreed about the price of one of his items. Before the situation could escalate, the police suddenly dropped by and paid off the couple with money and erased the memories of the interaction from the salesman without the salesman even consenting to it. Then a few days later I witnessed the same couple confronting the salesman again to get compensated. They were able to take advantage of the faults of the system, get rewarded from it, and suffer no consequences.”
                <br><br>
                “Wait what? That’s crazy! How can you take advantage of our memories like that?”
                <br><br>
                “I know, it’s so immoral.  The values of this universe feel misplaced. I appreciate that I can live without my messed up arm in this world, but I don’t feel happiness should be the fundamental philosophy of this world. People take for granted the happiness that you gain from working for it. They will treat artificial happiness as genuine. The framework of this world is fragile, and erasing and modifying memories is certainly not a justifiable tool for them to maintain that order,” Ade continues.
                <br><br>
                “I get what you’re saying, but what can we even do about it?”
                <br><br>
                “The person I talked to told me about a way we can escape from this world. We have to go to a garage near the suburbs. A few guys have successfully escaped using the glitch, but the researchers may have already noticed and the bug may be patched soon. I need you to make a decision now. Can you really continue living in this world with all this in mind, regardless of whether they have good intentions or not?”
