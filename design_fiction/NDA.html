                After what feels like forever of going back and forth, you decide to call Arjun. As you dial the numbers into your phone you can feel your hand shaking. Finally, the call goes through. 
                <br><br>
                “Hello, this is Arjun, who is this?”
                <div class="ellipses">***TWO WEEKS LATER***</div>     
                It’s been two weeks since your last talk with Arjun. You decided to sign the non-disclosure agreement. It isn’t your place to make decisions for other people. It really was happier and less problematic in VR, and if people decide that they want to live in a place like that, who are you to stop them? You tell yourself, “This is all for the greater good of humanity.” Plus, the company has compensated you greatly for your troubles, so it’s a win-win for everyone. Now you no longer have to worry about whether or not you should publicize PETAR because you contractually are not allowed to. The burden has been lifted.
                <br><br>
                You had planned to visit Layla earlier in the week, but she wouldn’t speak to you, which is understandable. Thinking back to your conversation with Arjun, he had offered you a job as a PETAR ambassador, which you promptly turned down. It was a nice gesture for PETAR to reach out, but deep down it still felt wrong for you to endorse PETAR. 
                <br><br>
                You decide to invest your money and live out your days being financially stress-free. You haven’t heard anything about PETAR since you signed the NDA and intend to keep it that way.
