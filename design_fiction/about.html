                In the fictional city of Pinedale, a group of scientists have created a prototype for a new virtual reality technology designed for psychotherapy titled the Pinedale Extrinsic Therapeutic Alternate Reality (AKA PETAR). PETAR is meant for those who are physically disabled to live an alternate life through Virtual Reality. However, this technology still is far from perfect and has many flaws. 
                <br><br>
                The protagonist is a young adult, Lubna, who recently became physically disabled after a car accident and decided to enroll in the virtual reality program. Our story will start with Lubnaâ€™s life in virtual reality. She faces different choices that affect the outcome of the story and Lubna's character, such as whether she wants to stay in the virtual reality or leave.
                <br><br>
                Throughout the story Lubna is faced with various ethical topics. If the reader decides for Lubna to stay in Virtual Reality, Lubna explores the concepts of happiness and virtue. If the reader chooses for Lubna to leave Virtual Reality, Lubna explores the concepts of duty, utilitarianism and professional responsibility.
