			<h2>John Berger's Way of Seeing</h2>
			<p>
				John Berger’s Documentary “Ways of Seeing” discusses the perception of art and visuals and its evolution throughout the years. He brings up a lot of points that I feel I had always internally known. For example, in the last two episodes Berger discusses how art defines the perception of beauty and wealth throughout the ages. This idea was not new knowledge to me and actually reminded me of a similar conversation I’ve had (although I cannot recall where or when it took place). We discussed how female beauty changed shape throughout the years and it was recorded through forms of art: from old Roman statues would portray women with plump, soft features and crown hairstyles to slim boxy silhouettes and short bob cuts in the 1920s.

				In the second documentary episode, Berger holds a discussion with a group of women regarding social standards and female beauty. During the discussion, one woman brings up an argument that men and women are both narcissistic, and discusses how women strive to appear beautiful and also strive to find men who are quote-on-quote “worthy” and successful as attractive. In turn, unlike women, the new idea of attractive men is no longer their physical appearance, but more successful. This is an idea that Asian women were considered beautiful if they had porcelain skin and skinny figures while Asian men were desired to be chubbier as it portrayed a symbol of wealth and prosperity.

				Berger also brings up points that I definitely never considered before. One of the big points that stood out to me was how cameras and photography can take away from the uniqueness of art. Personally, I have never attended a live music concert (I HAVE gone to classical recitals and dance performances but I don’t consider them to be the same). I know that it is definitely not the same––everyone always tells me that the live experience is so different from something like a YouTube video or just listening to them on Spotify––but I never really bothered to go to one because I figured I could just find the music online or what not. I didn’t really consider it as taking away specialness from the artists.
