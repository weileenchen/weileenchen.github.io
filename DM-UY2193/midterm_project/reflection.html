            <div id="reflection"> There's no such thing as being truly blind to skin color, ethnicity, gender, etc. Although not everyone may admit it, we all have implicit bias. Everyone can see differences, but it's what we associate them with that truly matters. <br> <br> The goal of this project was to bring self-awareness to our own implicit bias. The images used were designed to try and make you consider the differences in a crowd of similarities and consider your immediate opinions of them. <br>
                The sooner we can accept our implicit bias, the sooner we can work towards changing it.
