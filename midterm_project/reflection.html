Everyone can see differences, but it's how we choose to associate them between each other that truly matters. <br> <br> The goal of this project was to bring self-awareness to our own implicit bias. The images used were designed to try and make you consider the differences in a crowd of similarities and consider your immediate opinions of them. because the sooner we can accept our implicit bias, the sooner we can work towards changing it.
