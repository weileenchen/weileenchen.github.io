		<h1>"As We May Think" and "Long Live the Web"</h1>
		<div class="center";>
			<p>
                “As We May Think” by Vannevar Bush and “Long Live the Web” by Tim Berners Lee are two different texts discussing different genres of technology and its evolution. Bush is concerned that while technology is constantly advancing, the human’s ability to process and manage information is not, and therefore technology will not be able to evolve as efficiently. Lee worries that the World Wide Web and its collaborative ability and freedom of expression is becoming threatened by centralization and privacy. Although both texts convey different messages, they both share the same concern that the future of technology could be dangerous.

				When reading “As We May Think”, something that particularly stuck to me was Bush’s claim that discoveries are often made at the quote-on-quote “wrong time” and discoveries were generally deemed worthy based on society’s stance at the given time. This is something I definitely agree with as it has been proven to have happened many times. Some of the most important scientific discoveries were once considered preposterous––like the Earth being round instead of flat––and often took decades to convince and officially prove.

				Something that surprised me about “Long Live the Web” was Lee’s discussion of net neutrality and his advocation for it. Although I admit I do not know much about net neutrality and the arguments for/against it, I have only ever personally heard about it in a negative light and I knew that it was once attempted but repealed later on. This article compelled me to start reading more about it so I could get a better sense of the topic.
